                M15+ and M101 bus routes stretch nearly across entire Manhattan
                and possess a Risk Score of ~0.594 and ~0.541, respectively.

                possesses a Risk Score of ~0.525, which comparatively speaking is
                close to Risk Scores of M15+ and M101.

                Other bus routes posses a Risk Score lower than 0.400, which

            Ultimately, the data suggests a reallocation of the ACE-supplied
            routes from lower-risk routes to higher-risk routes. Bus routes with
            lower-risk should continue to have ACE-supplied buses, but in fewer
            quantity than higher-risk routes. For neighborhoods, this means
            focusing resources where violations and ridership density combine to
            create the highest potential for accidents â€” for example, Jamaica,
            Longwood, Washington Heights (South), and East Harlem (North).
            Neighborhoods with Risk Scores near or below 0.400 should still be
            monitored but may warrant fewer interventions or longer review
            cycles, allowing resources to be concentrated where they are most
            needed.

          <h3 className="font-bold text-xl">Recommendations</h3>
          <p className="text-start md:mx-16">
            <ul className="list-disc list-outside ps-4 space-y-2 my-2">
              <li>
                Prioritize enforcement and infrastructure improvements on
                high-risk routes.
              </li>
              <li>Introduce more bus routes to ACE program.</li>
              <li>
                Reallocate ACE buses from lesser-risk bus routes to higher-risk
                ones.
                <ul className="list-[circle] list-outside ps-4 space-y-2 my-2">
                  <li>
                    Or introduce more ACE buses into the system (either through
                    modernization or new bus).
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                More ACE data will allow us to create a more accurate prediction
                of risk, which would allow MTA to have more detailed and
                reliable map and charts of risk score for bus routes or
                neighborhoods.

              <li>Some violations may be underreported.</li>

                Environmental factors (weather, road design, traffic signal

                The analysis does not account for the effectiveness of existing
