# Bus Route & Neighborhood Risk Analysis

Identifying high-risk bus routes and neighborhoods using ACE/ABLE violations, bus speeds, and bus total ridership data.

## Introduction

Urban bus systems are vital for mobility, but safety remains a pressing issue. Our team investigates how bus route characteristics-ACE (and ABLE) violations, speeds, and ridership-affect accident risk.

- **Problem:** Develop a Bus Route Risk Score and Neighborhood Risk Score estimating accident probability.
- **Business Question:** Which bus routes and neighborhoods have the highest accident likelihood?
- **Focus:** Identify dangerous routes and neighborhoods to prioritize safety interventions.

## Dictionary of Terms

Quick reference for key terms and acronyms used throughout this report.

**ACE (Automated Camera Enforcement)**

- NYC program that uses bus-mounted camera systems to detect bus lane, bus stop, and parking violations along bus routes.

**ABLE**

- “Automated Bus Lane Enforcement” - similar to ACE but focused on bus lane priority enforcement on select corridors.

**Double Parked Violation**

- A violation that occurs when a bus is blocked by or stops next to a double-parked vehicle, potentially causing delays or unsafe conditions.

**Bus Stop Violation**

- A violation that is recorded when a bus is obstructed or stops improperly at a bus stop.

**Bus Lane Violation**

- A violation that is recorded when a vehicle blocks or drives in a dedicated bus lane, interfering with bus flow and schedule adherence.

**Ridership**

- Average number of passengers boarding buses (plus transfers) on a given route or neighborhood.

**Speed**

- The average operating speed of a bus on a route or the average operating speed of a buses operating within a neighborhood.

**Neighborhood (NTA)**

- NYC Neighborhood Tabulation Areas (NTAs) used to aggregate violations, speeds, and ridership data spatially.

**Risk Score**

- Composite metric combining violations, bus speeds, and ridership to estimate the likelihood of accidents or serious incidents. We utilize a weighted average in this report instead of weighted sum.

**Normalized Value**

- A rescaled number (0–1) so different factors can be compared fairly within the risk score formula.

**Up next:** A closer look at the ACE/ABLE Enforced Bus Routes dataset, our primary input for filtering the datasets you saw above.

## ACE/ABLE Enforced Bus Routes

B25, B26, B35, B41, B42, B44+, B46+, B62, B82+, BX3, BX5, BX6+, BX7, BX12+, BX19, BX20, BX28, BX35, BX36, BX38, BX41+, M2, M4, M14+, M15+, M23+, M34+, M42, M60+, M79, M86+, M100, M101, Q5, Q6, Q43, Q44+, Q53+, Q54, Q58, Q69, S46, S79+

## From Raw Data to Processed Insights

After gathering enforcement, speed, and ridership datasets, we ran SoQL queries and Python scripts to combine and clean the data. This produced our set of datasets (seen in "Our Data at a Glance" below), which powers the analysis.

Appendix: Full Python scripts too large to display here are linked [here](#appendix).

### SoQL Query to get ACE Violations per Bus Route between 2020 and 2025\*

Counts total automated camera enforcement (ACE) violations per bus route, as well as breaking them down into bus stop, double parked, and bus lane categories.

    SELECT
      bus_route_id,
      COUNT(*) AS total_violations,
      SUM(CASE WHEN violation_type = 'MOBILE BUS STOP' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS bus_stop_violations,
      SUM(CASE WHEN violation_type = 'MOBILE DOUBLE PARKED' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS double_parked_violations,
      SUM(CASE WHEN violation_type = 'MOBILE BUS LANE' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS bus_lane_violations
    WHERE first_occurrence > '2019-12-31T23:59:59'
    GROUP BY bus_route_id

### SoQL Query to get Bus Speeds for ACE/ABLE Enforced Routes

inRouteList is a variable containing the set of ACE/ABLE Enforced Bus Routes we mentioned earlier.

Retrieves total mileage, total operating time, and computes average speed for each enforced route.

    SELECT
      route_id,
      SUM(total_mileage) AS total_mileage,
      SUM(total_operating_time) AS total_operating_time,
      AVG(average_speed) AS average_speed
    WHERE route_id IN (${inRouteList})
    GROUP BY route_id

### SoQL Query to get Bus Total Ridership for ACE/ABLE Enforced Routes

inRouteList is a variable containing the set of ACE/ABLE Enforced Bus Routes we mentioned earlier.

Returns ridership totals plus transfer total for the list of enforced routes, which is combined into total_riders on the website.

    SELECT
      route_id,
      SUM(total_mileage) AS total_mileage,
      SUM(total_operating_time) AS total_operating_time,
      AVG(average_speed) AS average_speed
    WHERE route_id IN (${inRouteList})
    GROUP BY route_id

\*We limited main dataset to 2020-2025 due to Ridership and Speeds being in that range.

### Python Scripts for Neighborhood Grouping (using geopandas, pandas, numpy)

These scripts turn the raw data of NYC Neighborhoods GeoJSON and ACE Violations (2020-2025) dataset into clean, aggregated table the website uses for risk score calculations of neighborhoods.

#### neighborhood_grouper.py

Reads all ACE violation points, assigns them to NYC neighborhood polygons (spatial join), counts totals and by type, and outputs two CSVs: `violation_totals.csv` (per neighborhood) and `violation_counts_by_type.csv` (per neighborhood & type).

#### csv_merger.py

Merges `violation_totals.csv` and `violation_counts_by_type.csv` into one file `neighborhood_stats.csv`, aggregating bus routes, total violations, and violation types per neighborhood.

#### neighborhood_final_stats_maker.py

Reads `neighborhood_stats.csv`, plus speed and ridership data for 2020–2025, calculates each neighborhood’s _average speed_ and _average total ridership_ across all its bus routes (floors ridership values), and saves as `neighbor_with_speeds_ridership.csv`.

## Risk Factors & Score Formula

Using our cleaned datasets, we derived a composite Risk Score for each bus route and neighborhood. This score combines multiple risk factors into a normalized value between 0 and 1.

`RiskScore(route/neighborhood) = Σ wᵢ * (xᵢ - min(xᵢ)) / (max(xᵢ) - min(xᵢ)) with Σ wᵢ = 1`

| **Risk Factor (xᵢ)**     | **Weight (wᵢ)** | **Rationale**                              |
| ------------------------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Double Parked Violations | 0.28            | High correlation with blockage & accidents |
| Bus Stop Violations      | 0.18            | Frequent stop-area conflicts               |
| Bus Lane Violations      | 0.12            | Impedes safe bus travel                    |
| Speed of Bus             | 0.22            | Higher speeds, higher severity             |
| Bus Ridership            | 0.20            | More riders = greater impact               |

## Findings

With weights applied, we computed risk scores for each route and neighborhood. The following chart and map showcase the outcomes of our analysis.

Conclusion
----------

### Findings

Our analysis highlights routes and neighborhoods with the highest estimated risk of accidents.

*   M15+ and M101 bus routes stretch nearly across entire Manhattan and possess a Risk Score of ~0.594 and ~0.541, respectively.
    *   This could be due to the longer length of the bus routes.
*   Despite BX19 being a shorter route compared to M15+ and M101, it possesses a Risk Score of ~0.525, which comparatively speaking is close to Risk Scores of M15+ and M101.
*   Other bus routes posses a Risk Score lower than 0.400, which suggests less need of intervention and fewer ACE-supplied buses.
*   BX3, BX7, BX20, BX38, M4, M14+, M42, M100, Q6 bus routes are mostly short routes, seeing fewer ridership and violations.
    *   Thus, their Risk Score is 0.000.
*   Jamaica Neighborhood possesses the highest Risk Score, ~0.562.
    *   Jamaica has the most total violations, with the total weight of them being 0.58.
*   Longwood, Washington Heights (South), and East Harlem (North) come in after Jaimaca with high Risk Score of ~0.520, ~0,505, and ~0.482 (respectively).
    *   Longwood has the most double parked violations, our biggest risk factor (weight of 0.28).
    *   BX36 and M101, highest-risk bus routes, are the bus routes that serve Washington Heights (South) neighborhood.
    *   M15+ and M101, highest-risk bus routes, are the bus routes that serve East Harlem (North) neighborhood.
*   Upper East Side-Lenox Hill-Roosevelt Island, Upper East Side-Yorkville, Flatbush, and East Flatbush-Rugby have Risk Scores of ~0.455, ~0.442, ~0.437, and ~0.421 (respectively).
    *   M15+ and M101, highest-risk bus routes, are the bus routes that serve Upper East Side-Lenox Hill-Roosevelt Island and Upper East Side-Yorkville neighborhoods.
    *   Flatbush and East Flatbush-Rugby are within top-10 of highest total violations (main contributor is bus stop violations)
*   The other neighborhoods possess a Risk Score of close to ~0.400 or less.

*   Safety intervention is not priority within a reasonable timeframe for these neighborhoods.

Ultimately, the data suggests a reallocation of the ACE-supplied routes from lower-risk routes to higher-risk routes. Bus routes with lower-risk should continue to have ACE-supplied buses, but in fewer quantity than higher-risk routes. For neighborhoods, this means focusing resources where violations and ridership density combine to create the highest potential for accidents — for example, Jamaica, Longwood, Washington Heights (South), and East Harlem (North). Neighborhoods with Risk Scores near or below 0.400 should still be monitored but may warrant fewer interventions or longer review cycles, allowing resources to be concentrated where they are most needed.

### Recommendations

*   Prioritize enforcement and infrastructure improvements on high-risk routes.
*   Introduce more bus routes to ACE program.
*   Reallocate ACE buses from lesser-risk bus routes to higher-risk ones.
    *   Or introduce more ACE buses into the system (either through modernization or new bus).
*   More ACE data will allow us to create a more accurate prediction of risk, which would allow MTA to have more detailed and reliable map and charts of risk score for bus routes or neighborhoods.

### Limitations

*   Some violations may be underreported.
*   Environmental factors (weather, road design, traffic signal timing, driver behavior) and socioeconomic variables are not included but may influence accident risk.
*   There are bus routes that are not within ACE program.
*   Longer bus routes may naturally accumulate more violations and ridership.
*   The analysis does not account for the effectiveness of existing safety interventions.
    *   High-risk areas may have ongoing mitigation efforts not reflected in the current data.

    SELECT
        bus_route_id,
        COUNT(*) AS total_violations,
        SUM(CASE WHEN violation_type = 'MOBILE BUS STOP' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS bus_stop_violations,
        SUM(CASE WHEN violation_type = 'MOBILE DOUBLE PARKED' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS double_parked_violations,
        SUM(CASE WHEN violation_type = 'MOBILE BUS LANE' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS bus_lane_violations
    WHERE first_occurrence > '2019-12-31T23:59:59'
    GROUP BY bus_route_id

### SoQL Query to Get Bus Speeds for ACE/ABLE Enforced Routes

inRouteList is a variable containing the set of ACE/ABLE Enforced Bus Routes we mentioned earlier.

    SELECT
      route_id,
      SUM(total_mileage) AS total_mileage,
      SUM(total_operating_time) AS total_operating_time,
      AVG(average_speed) AS average_speed
    WHERE route_id IN (${inRouteList})
    GROUP BY route_id

### SoQL Query to Get Bus Total Ridership for ACE/ABLE Enforced Routes

inRouteList is a variable containing the set of ACE/ABLE Enforced Bus Routes we mentioned earlier.

    SELECT
      route_id,
      SUM(total_mileage) AS total_mileage,
      SUM(total_operating_time) AS total_operating_time,
      AVG(average_speed) AS average_speed
    WHERE route_id IN (${inRouteList})
    GROUP BY route_id

\*We limited main dataset to 2020-2025 due to Ridership and Speeds being in that range.
